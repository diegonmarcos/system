# Research

This document contains research notes, links, and other relevant information gathered during the project.

## Spec-Kit Framework

- Researched the `spec-kit` framework to understand its structure and purpose.
- Found that it is a CLI-based workflow for spec-driven development with AI coding assistants.
- The file structure `0.constitution.md`, `1.spec.md`, `2.plan.md`, `3.research.md`, and `4.tasks.md` corresponds to the different phases of the development process.

## GCP Free-Tier VM

- Researched the correct `gcloud` command to create a VM instance that is eligible for the GCP free tier.
- Key parameters identified were `--machine-type=e2-micro`, the correct region/zone (e.g., `us-east1-b`), and `--boot-disk-size=30GB`.
