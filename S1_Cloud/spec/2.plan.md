# Plan

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for the project.

## Architecture

The architecture is simple and cost-effective. It consists of a single Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Machine (VM) instance. On this VM, Docker is used to run the n8n application as a container. A Docker volume is mounted to the container to ensure data persistence.

## Technology Stack

- **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **CLI:** gcloud CLI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Application:** n8n

## Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Provision a free-tier e2-micro VM on GCP.
- **Milestone 2:** Install Docker on the VM.
- **Milestone 3:** Deploy n8n using Docker Compose.
- **Milestone 4:** Configure a firewall rule to expose the n8n service.
