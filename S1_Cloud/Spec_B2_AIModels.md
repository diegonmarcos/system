That's an insightful question about security and model management! The answer depends on which Gemini pathway you are using: **Google AI Studio (Developer API)** or **Google Cloud (Vertex AI API)**.

## 1. Google AI Studio (Gemini Developer API) üé®

### **No, you cannot use separate API keys for each model.**

The **Gemini Developer API Key** (the one you get directly from AI Studio) is a single, broad key tied to your Google Account and a single project.

* **Model Access:** That single key grants access to **all** available models through the **Generative Language API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`)**, including all subtypes of Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, Flash-Lite, and other models like Imagen.
* **Security Control:** You cannot use this API key to restrict access to *only* `gemini-2.5-flash` while blocking `gemini-2.5-pro`. Any user possessing the key can call any model the associated account has permission to use.
* **Model Selection:** The model is selected by specifying its name (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`) **in the API request itself**, not through the API key.

## 2. Google Cloud (Vertex AI Gemini API) ‚òÅÔ∏è

### **Yes, you can achieve granular access control by model family, but not directly with an API key.**

On Google Cloud, the authentication moves away from simple API keys to **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**, which is the official method for controlling access at a granular level.

* **Method:** You would use **Service Accounts** and **IAM Roles** to define access permissions.
* **Model Granularity:** While you generally don't set permissions per *individual* model (like blocking `gemini-2.5-flash` but allowing `gemini-2.5-pro`), you can enforce security policies via **IAM** or **VPC Service Controls** that restrict access to the Vertex AI service itself.
* **The Best Practice:** For production environments and to ensure that only lower-cost models are used in certain applications (or vice versa), the best practice is to:

    1.  **Create Separate Service Accounts:** Create a dedicated service account for your "Flash" application and a separate one for your "Pro" application.
    2.  **Define IAM Roles:** Grant each service account only the necessary permissions to call the **Vertex AI API** (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`).
    3.  **Enforce Limits:** You can then use quotas, budgets, and environment variables on the VM or service running the application to ensure the code only calls the intended, cost-appropriate model (`gemini-2.5-flash` vs. `gemini-2.5-pro`).

In summary, for basic development via **AI Studio**, you get one key for all models. For enterprise use via **Vertex AI**, you use IAM/Service Accounts to control model access and spending based on the application's required permissions.
