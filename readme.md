# System Backend Development Learning Path

This repository documents my personal learning journey through the vast world of backend development. It serves as a collection of projects, notes, and custom-built libraries, focusing on fundamental concepts from the ground up.

## Core Areas of Focus

This learning path is structured around several key areas:

*   **System Programming:** Understanding the low-level workings of operating systems, including process management, inter-process communication, and system calls.
*   **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Implementing and applying various algorithms and data structures, which are the building blocks of efficient and scalable software.
*   **Graphics:** Exploring the fundamentals of computer graphics, from simple rendering techniques to more complex concepts.
*   **Custom Libraries:** Building my own libraries to solidify my understanding of core concepts and create reusable components.

## Projects Overview

The repository is organized into several sub-directories, each representing a specific project or learning module.

### C1_born2beroot

This project focuses on the fundamentals of system administration. The goal is to set up a virtual machine from scratch, configure it, and implement basic security measures. It's about understanding what it takes to have a functional and secure server environment.

### C2_pipex

This project is an introduction to inter-process communication in a Unix-like environment. It involves recreating the behavior of shell pipes (`|`), providing a deeper understanding of how commands can be chained together and how data flows between processes.

### C2_websrv

This project is about building a web server from scratch. It covers the basics of network programming, handling HTTP requests, and serving static or dynamic content.

### S1_Cloud

This section is dedicated to exploring cloud computing concepts. It includes notes and experiments with virtual machines, deploying applications, and managing cloud infrastructure.

### S2_docker

This project focuses on learning Docker and containerization. The goal is to understand how to create, manage, and deploy applications using Docker containers, a crucial skill in modern software development.
